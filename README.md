# Eetfestijn
This project was originally created for a checkout of the 'Eetfestijn' of a none profit organization (Hoogstraat 6 VWZ). The initial version was as created a WPF on .Net 4, but due to time constraints it was a 
quick and dirty implementation. The current implementation is a .net 5 project, relying heavily on MVVM principles and using a Material design theme.

As the none profit organization is in flanders, the UI of the project is completely in dutch (though source code is in English).
